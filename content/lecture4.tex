\section{Lecture 4: Marine Sediments}

\subsection{Marine sediments}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Sediment layers represent a record of Earth history, including:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Movement of tectonic plates
        \item Past changes in climate
        \item Ancient ocean circulation patterns
        \item Cataclysmic events (meteorites, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions)
    \end{itemize}
    \item Are a critical and active component of global
        biochemical cycles
    \item Marine sediments contain valuable economic resources
    \item Contain an enormous amount of biomass -- \textit{A frontier
        area of microbiological life} and a critical component of the global
        carbon cycle
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Sampling the seafloor}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Coring
    \item Coring tools are simple in design: a long metal pipe, with a
        very heavy weight 100-200kg, that falls down until it hits the
        seafloor
    \item Other tools for sampling the seafloor
\end{itemize}

In a neritic deposit you will recover 10ka of Earth's history
from 10m long sediment core.

In a Pelagic deposit, you can capture over 1Ma of Earth's history
from 10m long sediment core.

\subsection{Scientific drilling vs seabed coring}

\begin{itemize}
    \item A pipe is lowered to the bottom of the sea
    \item Inside of the pipe is a wire with a drill at the end
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Four main types of sediment}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Lithogenous (terrigenous)} -- composed of fragments of
        pre-existing rock material
    \item \textbf{Biogenous} -- composed of hard remains of once-living
        organisms
    \item \textbf{Hydrogenous} -- formed when dissolved materials come out of
        solution (precipitate)
    \item \textbf{Cosmogenous} -- derived from outer space
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Lithogenous sediment texture}

\begin{itemize}
    \item High energy $\longrightarrow$ low energy
    \item Bach to shallow marine, transition to deep marine
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Water-river transport and run-off}

In addition to sediment, the dissolved load is also an important contributor
to deep-sea sedimentation. It contains PO$_4$, NO$_3-$, and other nutrients
needed for plant growth, such as Ca+, HCO$_3$-, and H$_4$SiO$_4$, from which
pelagic organisms build their shells and skeletons.

\subsection{River transport and run-off}

Operates across the globe, from equatorial to polar regions.

\subsection{Windblown sediment}

Eolian (wind blown) sediment can be traced by looking at the quartz
concentration in some marine sediments.

Accumulation rates of windblown sediments in the deep sea are typically up to
a few mm/1000 years.

\subsection{Ice -- glaciers (icebergs) and sea ice}

They can carry coarse-grained material very far out to the sea.

\subsection{Turbidity currents and mass transport deposits}

\textbf{Graded bedding}: As the turbidity current slows, larger grains
settle first, followed by progressively finer grains.

\subsection{Biogenous: photosynthetic phytoplankton}

Phytoplankton blooms in the Barents Sea, off the northern coast of Norway

\subsection{Origin and composition of biogenous sediment}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Organisms that produce hard parts die
    \item Material rains down on the ocean floor and accumulates as:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Microscopic tests (shells)
            \item If sediment is made of at least 30\% shell material, it is
                called biogenous ooze
        \end{itemize}
    \item Microscopic biogenous shells are composed of 2 main chemical
        compounds:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Silica (SiO$_2$): Diatoms (algae -- plants), Radiolarian
                (protozoan -- animals)
            \item Calcium carbonate or calcite (CaCO$_3$):
                Coccolithophores (algae -- plants), Foraminifers
                (protozoan -- animals)
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Lithified biogenous sediment}

When biogenous ooze hardens and lithifies, it can form:
Diatomaceous earth (if composed of diatom-rich ooze) or Chalk (if composed of
coccolith-rich ooze).

\subsection{Distribution of Biogenous sediment}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Most biogenous ooze is found as pelagic (open ocean) deposits
    \item Factors affecting the distribution of biogenous ooze:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Productivity (amount of organisms living in surface waters)
            \item Destruction (dissolving at depth)
            \item Dilution (mixing with lithogenous clays)
        \end{itemize}
    \item Productivity is usually nutrient limited and is overcome in
        (1) areas where lithogenous sediment is delivered and (2) regions of
        upwelling
\end{itemize}
