\section{Lecture 9: Waves}

\subsection{How are waves formed?}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Waves are created by energy release (disturbances) including:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Wind
        \item Movement of media (air or fluids) of different densities
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Air-water = ocean waves
            \item Air-air = atmospheric waves
            \item Water-water = internal waves
        \end{itemize}
        \item Mass movement into the ocean (splash waves, but also
            commonly grouped into the category of tsunamis)
        \item Underwater seafloor movement (tsunami)
        \item Pull of the Moon and Sun (tides)
        \item Atmospheric pressure changes (seiches)
        \item Human activities (explosions)
    \end{itemize}
    \item All are examples of progressive waves, they move energy,
        not mass!
\end{itemize}
